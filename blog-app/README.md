### Navigation
- A header with easy access to the Home page, Login, and Sign-Up pages.

## Technical Details

### Frontend
- **React**: The application is built using React, leveraging component-based architecture for modularity.
- **React Router**: Handles routing between different pages such as Home, Blog Post, Login, and Sign Up.
- **State Management**: Managed using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

### Styling
- **CSS**: The application uses plain CSS for styling components.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive across various device sizes.

### Comments Functionality
- **LocalStorage**: Comments are stored in the browser’s `localStorage` to persist data across page reloads.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository** or download the source code.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/travel-blog-app.git
   cd travel-blog-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using npm.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` directory with optimized and minified files ready for deployment.
